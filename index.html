            Hello, I'm Bradley, an undergrad student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying mathematics, algorithms, and quantum computing.
            </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">who I am</h3>

            <p>
                I'm in love with all the different ways people solve problems—I've been learning about math, physics, and computer science for as long as I can remember, and I hope to make a career out of solving tough technical problems and finding crazy insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of all that, I try to get outside (to stay sane) as much as I can.
                I enjoy cooking, weightlifting, and making music.
                On campus, I play with Georgia Tech's
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2uiPUh_F6ew06quv1_DyVYCEHWEcYfb8">jazz ensemble</a>,
                and swim with our <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/swimclub/">swim club</a>
                —and best of all, I run intramural sports teams for every sport, every season.
                I'm also an avid pickleballer, and sometimes I like to go find parks and hikes around Atlanta.
            </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">what I'm doing</h3>

            <p>
                Along with taking classes (which are listed <a href="./courses.html">here</a>), I'm doing research with the
                <a href="https://crnch.gatech.edu">CRNCH Lab</a>
                at Georgia Tech's
                <a href="https://scs.gatech.edu">School of Computer Science</a>.
                There, I help out with implementing important quantum algorithms in a new under-development
                <a href="https://qwerty.cc.gatech.edu">programming language</a>
                for quantum computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2023 I worked with the
                <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/csm/research/theoretical-particle-physics.php">particle theory group</a>
                at Kennesaw State University. There, I was immersed in quantum field theory within and beyond the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a>.
                My work made predictions for a possible experiment at a collider based on a model for an undiscovered particle, the Z' boson.
