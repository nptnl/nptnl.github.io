            Hi, I'm Bradley, an undergrad student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying mathematics, quantum technology, and economics.
            </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">who I am</h3>

            <p>
                I'm in love with all the different ways people solve problems—I've been studying math, physics, economics, and computer science for quite some time, and I hope to forge a career out of solving tough problems in one or more of these fields.
                Particularly, I'm super interested in algorithms, computing theory, combinatorial structures, microeconomic theory, and quantum information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of all that, I try to get outside (to stay sane) as much as I can.
                I enjoy cooking, weightlifting, and making music.
                I lifeguard at Georgia Tech's pool (site of the 1996 Olympics!), play with our
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2uiPUh_F6ew06quv1_DyVYCEHWEcYfb8">jazz ensemble</a>,
                train with our <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/swimclub/">swimming</a> and
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gtbjjclub/home">Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> clubs,
                and best of all, I run a club that organizes intramural sports teams for every sport.
            </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">what I'm doing</h3>

            <p>
                I'm an incoming quantitative research intern at <a href="https://www.ice.com/index">ICE</a> (no not that ICE).
                I'll be there from May to August 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2024 and 2025 I researched with the
                <a href="https://crnch.gatech.edu">CRNCH Lab</a>
                at Georgia Tech's
                <a href="https://scs.gatech.edu">School of Computer Science</a>.
                There, my work focused on implementing important quantum algorithms in a new under-development
                <a href="https://qwerty.cc.gatech.edu">programming language</a>
                for quantum computers.
                I also won two salary awards from the Institute to fund my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2023 I worked with the
                <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/csm/research/theoretical-particle-physics.php">particle theory group</a>
                at Kennesaw State University. There, I was immersed in quantum field theory within and beyond the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a>.
                My work made predictions for a possible experiment at a collider based on a model for an undiscovered particle, the Z' boson.
